Notes on privacy settings:
 - Only the user that linked his or her Dataverse account can change the Dataverse or dataset linked from that account. Other contributors can still deauthorize the node.
 - For contributors with write permission to the node:
    - The user can access the dataset title, doi, host Dataverse, and citation.
    - The draft version and most-recently published version of a dataset are accessible as separate lists.
    - Files from either the draft or published version can be viewed or downloaded.
    - Files from the draft version can be uploaded, updated, or deleted.
    - Draft versions can be published.
 - For non-contributors, when a node is public:
    - The user can access the dataset title, doi, host Dataverse, and citation.
    - Only the most-recently published version of the dataset is accessible.
        - If there are no published files, the dataset is not displayed.
    - Files from the published version can be viewed or downloaded.
 - For non-contributors, when a node is private, there is no access to the Dataverse add-on.
