    Paginated list of comment replies ordered by their `date_created`. Each resource contains the full representation
    of the comment, meaning additional requests to an individual comment's detail view are not necessary.
    Comment replies can be created via the NodeCommentsList endpoint `/v2/nodes/node_id/comments`.

    ###Permissions

    Comments on public nodes are given read-only access to everyone. If the node comment-level is "private,"
    only contributors have permission to comment. If the comment-level is "public" any logged-in OSF user can comment.
    Comments on private nodes are only visible to contributors and administrators on the parent node.

    ##Attributes

    OSF comment reply entities have the "comments" `type`.

    ##Links

    See the [JSON-API spec regarding pagination](http://jsonapi.org/format/1.0/#fetching-pagination).

    ##Query Params

    + `filter[deleted]=True|False` -- filter comment replies based on whether or not they are deleted.

    The list of comment replies includes deleted comments by default. The `deleted` field is a boolean and can be
    filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, or `1`. Note that quoting `true` or `false` in
    the query will cause the match to fail regardless.

    + `filter[date_created][comparison_operator]=YYYY-MM-DDTH:M:S` -- filter comment replies based on date created.

    Comment replies can also be filtered based on their `date_created` and `date_modified` fields. Possible comparison
    operators include 'gt' (greater than), 'gte'(greater than or equal to), 'lt' (less than) and 'lte'
    (less than or equal to). The date must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD and the time is optional.

    + `filter[target]=target_id` -- filter comments based on their target id.

    The list of comments can be filtered by target id. For example, to get all comments with target = comment,
    the target_id would be the comment_id.
